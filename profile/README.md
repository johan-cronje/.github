# Johan Cronje
### Software Engineer / DevOps
- I am a seasoned developer with a background in multiple industries, primarily focusing on web backend development. I take pleasure in crafting REST APIs.
- Proficient in DevOps, particularly adept at enhancing the developer experience and optimizing platform functionality
- I predominantly function in roles as an individual contributor, frequently taking on responsibilities as a team lead and providing mentorship to less experienced developers
- Python is currently my favorite language, although I'm gradually incorporating Golang into my skill set. I have experience with a variety of languages such as Perl, PHP, C, C++, and more. I'm not particular about languages and can quickly adapt to new ones. While I lean towards avoiding Ruby, Java, C#, and .NET environments, I'm open to persuasion and may reconsider my preferences.
- Utilizing a suite of DevOps tools including Terraform, Packer, Jenkins, GitLab, Ansible, Artifactory, and more
- Extensive experience in managing multi-cloud environments, encompassing AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
- Within AWS, my expertise primarily revolves around EC2, ECS, and EKS services, complemented by proficiency in standard services like S3, CloudWatch, SES, IAM, and more
- Within Azure, my focus lies on Virtual Machines, while in Google Cloud, I specialize in Google Compute Engine, alongside their respective supporting services

## Source Code Project Examples
You can get insights into my coding style across different languages by exploring the following public repositories containing sample code:

### [python-demo](https://github.com/johan-cronje/python-demo)
This is a demo in Python of a simple REST API for a fictional insurance company, implementing a policy quote backend. Although developed with Flask, the preferred framework for this project is likely to be FastAPI now.

### [fastapi-k8s-demo](https://github.com/johan-cronje/fastapi-k8s-demo)
A simple demonstration of running a Python FastAPI application in Kubernetes. This example uses [K3d](https://k3d.io/) and requires Docker & [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) to be installed

### [fastapi-ecs-demo](https://github.com/johan-cronje/fastapi-ecs-demo)
Demonstration of Infrastructure as Code using standard Terraform resources with no third party modules, to deploy a Python FastAPI API application on AWS ECS

### [perl-demo](https://github.com/johan-cronje/perl-demo)
Example of an object-oriented Perl system designed to analyze an Apache web server access log, producing various statistics derived from a MaxMind GeoIP lookup.
