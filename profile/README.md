# Johan Cronje
### Software Engineer / DevOps
- I am a seasoned developer with a background in multiple industries, primarily focusing on web backend development. In particular, I enjoy creating REST APIs.
- Proficient in DevOps, adept at enhancing the developer experience and optimizing platform functionality
- I predominantly function in roles as an individual contributor, frequently taking on responsibilities as a team lead and providing mentorship to less experienced developers
- Python is currently my favorite language, although I'm gradually incorporating Golang into my skill set. I have experience with a variety of languages such as Perl, PHP, C, C++, and more. I'm not particular about languages and can quickly adapt to new ones.
- Experienced in the use of multiple DevOps tools including Terraform, Packer, Jenkins, GitLab, Ansible, Artifactory, and more
- Extensive experience in managing multi-cloud environments, encompassing AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
- In AWS, my expertise primarily revolves around EC2, ECS, and EKS services, complemented by proficiency in standard services like S3, CloudWatch, SES, IAM, and more
- With Azure, I've used mostly Virtual Machines, while in Google Cloud, Google Compute Engine, alongside their respective supporting services

## Software & DevOps projects
You can get insights into my coding style across different languages by exploring the following public repositories containing sample code:

| Repo | Description | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[python-demo](https://github.com/johan-cronje/python-demo)** | Basic REST API written in Python for a fictional insurance company, implementing a policy quote backend. Originally developed using Flask, the preferred framework for this project is likely to be FastAPI now. | Python |
| **[fastapi-k8s-demo](https://github.com/johan-cronje/fastapi-k8s-demo)** | Create a Kubernetes cluster and deploy a Python FastAPI workload to the cluster. Uses **K3d** to deploy a Kubernetes cluster in Docker. | [K3d](https://k3d.io/), Docker & [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) |
| **[terraform-k8s-demo](https://github.com/johan-cronje/terraform-k8s-demo)** | Deploy a Kubernetes cluster using Infrastructure as Code to AWS, Azure & Google Cloud with Terraform. | [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli), [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) and the CLI for each Cloud platform |
| **[fastapi-ecs-demo](https://github.com/johan-cronje/fastapi-ecs-demo)** | Deploy a Python FastAPI API workload on AWS ECS using native Terraform resources (with no modules). | [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli), [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) and the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) |
| **[perl-demo](https://github.com/johan-cronje/perl-demo)** | Example of an object-oriented Perl system designed to analyze an Apache web server access log, producing various statistics derived from a MaxMind GeoIP lookup. | Perl |
