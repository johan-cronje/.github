# Johan Cronje
### Software Engineer / DevOps
- Experienced developer in several industries, mostly web backend, enjoy creating REST APIs
- DevOps experience, especially on the developer experience / platform side
- Python is currently favorite language, but slowly starting to integrate Golang into my arsenal. I've also used Perl, PHP, C, C++ and many more. Not picky about languages, I can pick up anything fast. Prefer to avoid Ruby, java, C# & .Net environments, but I can be convinced to change my mind.
- DevOps tools Terraform, Packer, Jenkins, GitLab, Ansible, Artifactory, etc
- Multi cloud experience with AWS / Azure / Google Cloud
- In AWS most of my experience in EC2, ECS, EKS services in addition to the normal stuff (S3, CloudWatch, SES, IAM, etc)
- In Azure & Google Cloud mostly the EC2 equivalent (i.e. virtual machines) and the supporting services
- I mostly work in individual contributor roles, often as team lead & mentoring less experienced developers

## Source Code Project Examples
The sample code public repositories in this account should give you an idea of my coding style in various languages

### [python-demo](https://github.com/johan-cronje/python-demo)
This is a simple implementation in Python of a quote REST API for a fictional insurance company. Originally created using **Flask**, the likely choice for this project would be **FastApi** now.

### [perl-demo](https://github.com/johan-cronje/perl-demo)
A small OO-style Perl system that processes an Apache web server access log and displays various stats based on a Maxmind geo IP lookup

### [fastapi-ecs-demo](https://github.com/johan-cronje/fastapi-ecs-demo)
> [!NOTE]
> This one is a work in progress

Infrastructure as Code demo using Terraform that launches a Python FastApi application in AWS on ECS
