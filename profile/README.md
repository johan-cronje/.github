# Johan Cronje
### Software Engineer / DevOps
- I am a seasoned developer with a background in multiple industries, primarily focusing on web backend development. I take pleasure in crafting REST APIs.
- Proficient in DevOps, particularly adept at enhancing the developer experience and optimizing platform functionality
- I predominantly function in roles as an individual contributor, frequently taking on responsibilities as a team lead and providing mentorship to less experienced developers
- Python is currently my favorite language, although I'm gradually incorporating Golang into my skill set. I have experience with a variety of languages such as Perl, PHP, C, C++, and more. I'm not particular about languages and can quickly adapt to new ones. While I lean towards avoiding Ruby, Java, C#, and .NET environments, I'm open to persuasion and may reconsider my preferences.
- Utilizing a suite of DevOps tools including Terraform, Packer, Jenkins, GitLab, Ansible, Artifactory, and more
- Extensive experience in managing multi-cloud environments, encompassing AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
- Within AWS, my expertise primarily revolves around EC2, ECS, and EKS services, complemented by proficiency in standard services like S3, CloudWatch, SES, IAM, and more
- Within Azure, my focus lies on Virtual Machines, while in Google Cloud, I specialize in Google Compute Engine, alongside their respective supporting services

## Source Code Project Examples
You can get insights into my coding style across different languages by exploring the following public repositories containing sample code:

### [python-demo](https://github.com/johan-cronje/python-demo)
This Python implementation presents a straightforward quote REST API for an imaginary insurance company, initially developed with Flask. However, the preferred framework for this project is likely to be FastAPI now.

### [perl-demo](https://github.com/johan-cronje/perl-demo)
This is a compact object-oriented Perl system designed to analyze an Apache web server access log, presenting diverse statistics derived from a MaxMind GeoIP lookup.

### [fastapi-ecs-demo](https://github.com/johan-cronje/fastapi-ecs-demo)
> [!NOTE]
> This one is a work in progress

Demonstration of Infrastructure as Code employing Terraform, orchestrating the deployment of a Python FastAPI application on AWS ECS
